            <p class="para">My name is Hong Minh Nguyen and this is my first ever personal blog. I was born in Australia, but moved back to Vietnam for a few years before going back to Australia. Both of my parents are vietnamese and I have one older sister. Ever since
                being a kid, I've loved playing and building lego. Playing with lego gave me a chance to let my imagination and creativity run wild. In lego, there are countless of combinations to build from and every single build was unique. Lego is
                a toy that is suitable for all ages and it can help you in life as it can broaden your imagination and perspective. I made this blog because I also want to share my love for lego to more and more people, hoping to make love them too. </p>
